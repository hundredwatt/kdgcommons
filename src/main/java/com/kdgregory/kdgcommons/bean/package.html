Introspect bean-style objects.
<p>
This package exists to support the PracticalXML conversion code. It fixes
several problems that I perceived with <code>java.beans.Introspector</code>:

<ul>

<li> <b> Does not cache introspections </b>
<p>  <code>j.b.I</code> maintains an internal cache of introspections for
     for future use. While this cache is based on "weak" keys, so does not
     interfere with class unloading (at least not currently), it does retain
     the information "forever" unless explicitly flushed.

<li> <b> Ignores case in method names </b>
<p>  Older versions of <code>j.b.I</code> did not properly handle two initial
     capitals in a property name (eg: <code>XMLSomething</code>. This appears
     to have been fixed by JDK 1.8.

<li> <b> Ignores parameter type </b>
<p>  <code>j.b.I</code> tries to match parameter type on a setter to return value
     on a getter, and ignores setters where they don't match. For example, if you
     have <code>int foo</code>, with <code>int getFoo()</code>, <code>j.b.I</code>
     won't return <code>void setFoo(Integer value)</code> as the setter for this
     property.
<p>  By comparison, this introspector only looks at method name when identifying
     properties. Which means that you could use <code>void setFoo(String)</code>.

<li> <b> Resolves multiple setter methods for same property </b>
<p>  In the case where there are multiple getters/setters with the same name, the
     following ranking is applied:
     <ol>
     <li> Methods defined by subclass, over those defined by superclass.
          The subclass is assumed to be more specific.
     <li> Methods that get/take primitive values.
     <li> Methods that get/take primitive wrappers.
     <li> Methods that get/take <code>String</code>. Driven by the use of
          this introspector to translate to/from a text format.
     <li> Methods that get/take arbitrary objects.
     </ol>
     <p>

<li> <b> Resolves multiple getter methods for same property </b>
<p>  For class hierarchies that define covariant return types, will use
     the most specific type.

<li> <b> Ignores properties defined by <code>Object</code> </b>
<p>  <code>j.b.I.getBeanInfo()</code> provides two variants: one just takes the
     class to introspect, and the other takes a "stop" class to ignore parts of
     the inheritance hierarchy. In practice, you need to always call the second
     variant and provide <code>Object</code>, to avoid including <code>class</code>
     as a property.
<p>  By comparison, this introspector optimizes for the common case (been classes
     that directly extend <code>Object</code>).

<li> <b> Does not rely on <code>setAccessible()</code> </b>
<p>  By default, this  introspector only identifies public getter and setter
     methods. For a properly designed bean, these will be sufficient to marshall
     and unmarshall instances of that bean class. It also means that this class
     will work in a JVM that has a security manager (at the time of writing, this
     meant applets).
<p>  If you do need access to private methods, you can construct the introspector
     with a flag that enables <code>setAccessible()</code>.
</ul>
